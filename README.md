# Autonav

## What is it?

Back in my DOS days, I'd make little batch files in my path that had the same names as folders I'd often use.  That way, if I wanted to go to a specific folder, I wouldn't have to `cd` all the way into it.

This is like those batch files, but automatic.

## How do I use it?

First fill out the `autonav.ini` file.  The `source` autonav.sh, preferably in your `.bashrc`

Then, to turn it on, run the bash function `autonav`.  Now you can just type in the name of a folder to go there.
